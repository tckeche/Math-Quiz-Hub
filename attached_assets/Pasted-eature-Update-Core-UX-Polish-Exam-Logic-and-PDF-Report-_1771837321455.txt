eature Update: Core UX Polish, Exam Logic, and PDF Report Overhaul

Please implement the following 7 critical updates across the student and admin workflows. Ensure all UI changes strictly adhere to our established SOMA by MCEC futuristic dark theme (slate-950 background, violet/cyan gradients, glassmorphism).

1. Student Exam Logic: Auto-Submit on Timeout

Issue: Currently, if the timer runs out, the exam might not save.

Fix: Update the countdown timer's useEffect in the Student Quiz component. When timeLeft reaches exactly 0, immediately trigger the handleSubmit function automatically so the student is graded on whatever they have answered up to that point.

2. Student Exam Logic: Skip Question Feature

Fix: In the active question view, add a secondary "Skip Question" button next to the "Next" button.

Logic: Clicking this should record the answer as null or an empty string "" in the local state, move to the next question, and ensure the backend grading logic treats an empty answer as 0 marks (incorrect) without throwing an error.

3. Student Post-Exam & Re-entry Dashboard

Fix: When a student successfully submits an exam, OR if they attempt to open an exam they have already completed, route them to a "Results View" instead of the active quiz.

UI Elements to Display:

Show their calculated score and percentage prominently (e.g., "Grade: 85%").

Display this exact text prompt below the score: "Please wait for your tutor to evaluate your points of weakness."

Provide a primary button: "View Detailed Performance Report" (which generates/downloads the AI PDF).

4. Admin UX: Back to Assessments Navigation

Fix: In the Admin mode (specifically inside the Quiz Builder or individual Quiz View), ensure there is a highly visible, top-left navigation button (e.g., ← Back to Assessments) that uses React Router to return the admin smoothly to the main /admin dashboard list.

5. Admin UX: Logout Redirect

Fix: Update the admin logout function. Once the session or token is cleared, strictly redirect the user back to the main public landing page (Maps('/') or window.location.href = '/').

6. AI Analysis PDF: Header & Branding Formatting

Fix: Overhaul the HTML/CSS template used for the PDF generation (whether using react-to-print or a backend PDF library).

The Header Must Include:

The MCEC Logo (fetch from the /public folder).

Main Title: Performance report for [Student Name & Surname]

Subtitle 1: Topic: [Name of Assessment]

Subtitle 2: Date Taken: [Formatted Date]

Prominent Score: Grade: [XX]%

7. AI Analysis PDF: Content & Numbering Formatting

Numbering Fix: Ensure the mapping function that renders the questions on the PDF strictly re-indexes the questions starting from 1 (e.g., Question 1, Question 2), regardless of their original database IDs.

Content Formatting: Ensure the "Areas of Improvement" and explanations generated by the AI are formatted strictly as clean HTML bulleted lists (<ul>, <li>) for maximum readability.
